#This script will retrieve the connection log from the specified log path and filter it to only include records from the previous 12 hours. 
#The output will include the time of the connection, the username (if authenticated), the IP address, and the user agent (browser) used for each connection. 
#You can modify the Select-Object line to include other fields as needed.
#Note that this script assumes that the IIS logging format is set to the default W3C format. 
#If your IIS server is using a different logging format, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
